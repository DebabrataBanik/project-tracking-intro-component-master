### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### My Process

Building the mobile layout first to deal with the hamburger navigation icon and designing the navigation modal. 
Adjusting the illustration kind of complicated things for me, maybe it can be done in an easier way but it looks allright.

One new thing I learned, since I was increasing the width of img beyond its container or even viewport to get the desired outcome, I knew that in order to avoid the horizontal scrolling I have to restrict overflow by setting `overflow: hidden` but upon applying that to just the body wasn't enough for some reason, when I added the same to the `html` element it was able to remove the scroll. I need to look into that.   

### Continued Development

Implement some transistion delay or some kind of animation on navigation modal. I
Build the same using some other framwork.
